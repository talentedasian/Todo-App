<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

A Todo App made with various Spring Framework Modules. Initially, I thought of letting the users make a decision whether to send email notifications if 
the deadline of their Todos would soon meet. After some research and trials, I guess I could do it a little later than I had plan.

### Built With


* [Spring](https://spring.io/)
* [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security)
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* [Spring Hateoas](https://spring.io/projects/spring-hateoas)
* [Spring Data Jpa](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa)
* [Jjwt](https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

1. Install your database of choice. Mine was Postgresql.
2. Find the `application.properties` file inside the `/src/main/resources` directory and change the settings to your appropriate database of choice.
3. In this step, you could either choose to create keys for JWT Signing via the library or create a keystore. If you wanna create a keystore, you're on your own but if you choose to just create it during application startup, follow through.
    1. Create a class or just simply pick a class that would be responsible for creating and holding your keys.
    2. Point the keys needed for the `JwtProvider` class and `JwtAuthFilter` to the class needed for the JWT to work.

### Prerequisites

## Usage
1. This backend currently requires a JWT to be present in an authorization header. Since this backend generates keys on application startup and does not provide a keystore when the backend generates a JWT, that JWT is invalid when the application starts up or restarts.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
