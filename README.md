<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A Todo App made with various Spring Framework Modules. Initially, I thought of letting the users make a decision whether to send email notifications if 
the deadline of their Todos would soon meet. After some research and trials, I guess I could do it a little later than I had plan.

### Built With


* [Spring](https://spring.io/)
* [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security)
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* [Spring Hateoas](https://spring.io/projects/spring-hateoas)
* [Spring Data Jpa](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa)
* [Jjwt](https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

1. Install your database of choice. Mine was Postgresql.
2. Find the `application.properties` file inside the `/src/main/resources` directory and change the settings to your appropriate database of choice.
3. In this step, you could either choose to create keys for JWT Signing via the library or create a keystore. If you wanna create a keystore, you're on your own but if you choose to just create it during application startup, follow through.
    1. Create a class or just simply pick a class that would be responsible for creating and holding your keys.
    2. Point the keys needed for the `JwtProvider` class and `JwtAuthFilter` to the class needed for the JWT to work.
4. Navigate through `/src/main/resources` and you will find different application specific properties. These are properties that are appropriate for different environments such as `application-test.properties` for github actions testing and for local environment testing, `application-development.properties`for local development properties, and `application-production.properties`
    1. The `application-test.properties` points to a docker container running a postgres image. You can use any means of running a postgresql database and just   put the apppropriate spring datasource properties into the properties file.
    2. If you navigate through the `application-production.properties` file, there is no spring datasource properties like `spring.datasource.url` or `spring.datasrouce.password`. This is because the app is hosted on heroku and has a postgresql plugin. Heroku takes care of the mapping of the spring datasource properties thus the empty spring datasource property file.

### Prerequisites

## Usage
1. This backend currently requires a signed JWT to be present in an authorization header. Since this backend generates keys on application startup and does not provide a keystore when the backend generates a JWT, that JWT is invalid when the application starts up or restarts.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

1. Email API Service to send email notifications for nearing deadline Todos
2. Protected Resource Test Cases
3. Create a keystore for signed JWTs.
4. Host a postgresql database on the cloud to achieve duplicates of backend
5. For now, the app uses Twillio's sms api. With this, the app can only send to limited phone numbers which are also verified by your Twillio account.
6. Give a warning if `todo` is set to sendable but there are no phone numbers registered for the user.
